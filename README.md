**NOTA:** This configuration is to your liking, but it is recommended to do so.

**3.-** Once u have disabled most panels, showing only the **'Sandbox Panel'** and **'Visitors'** panel active, u must go to your Home, u will press the 'Edit' button that is in the **'Sandbox Panel'** frame, and u do click on the option '**Edit Custom HTML / CSS'.**

**4.-** Finally, if you're using a mobile device or computer, you will open the **.html** file with a *notepad*, or with a *text document*, we proceed to copy the 'stylesheet' content, the content that is inside **<'Style'>** and the content that is inside **<'body'>**, you will paste it in **'Edit custom HTML / CSS'**, use the save option and ready, you will have a new template. **(Note that on some occasions the panels have to be accommodated or moved, so that the design fits the structure of the code.)**
